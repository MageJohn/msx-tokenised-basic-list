# msx-tokenised-basic-list

This is a program to read a [tokenised MSX-BASIC](https://www.msx.org/wiki/MSX-BASIC_file_formats#Tokenized_BASIC) file. It was originally written by Vincent van Dam, back in 1997 (the year I was born, incidentally).

I have formatted it with clang-tidy and fixed the warnings that a modern C compiler gives about the code. It compiles and runs on my modern 64 bit Linux machine just fine.

Vincent's original code is in the first commit to this repository, and is available on his website, http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~vincentd/.
